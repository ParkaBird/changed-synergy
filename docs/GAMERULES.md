# Changed: Synergy game rules

Boolean rules use `/gamerule <name> true|false`. The initial-reputation rule accepts an integer.
Thirteen boolean rules default to `true`; No Civilization Mode defaults to `false`.
Initial reputation defaults to `0`. The same 15 rules appear under **World Rules** in Synergy's configuration page.
Operators can apply edits with **Done**; other players can inspect server values.

With Synergy installed, Changed's `changed:keepConscious` defaults to `true` for
new worlds. Existing worlds retain their saved value, including `false`; updating
the mod does not override it. Use `/gamerule changed:keepConscious` to check the
current world's value, or `/gamerule changed:keepConscious true` to enable it.

Changed's own `changed:keepConscious` rule also applies to Synergy. When it is
`false`, forced transfur ends in death instead of starting a takeover, including
transfur by an Instinct-mode player. Confirmed voluntary friendship/bond transfur,
chosen starting origins and temporary protective wrapping remain safe. Turning
the rule back on restores the configured takeover routes.

| Rule | What it controls |
| --- | --- |
| `changedSynergyNativeOrigins` | Offers first-time human/native species selection. Native origins require TrueTransfur. When on, permanent-origin features apply only to native players; the separate Human-Origin Instinct Control setting can permit human control mode. When off, TrueTransfur's ordinary scope is restored. Saved origins are retained. |
| `changedSynergyNativePvPReputation` | Reputation effects for attacks on native faction players, with recent self-defense exceptions. Also requires faction reputation to be enabled. |
| `changedSynergyNpcAI` | Investigation, coordinated pursuit, water pursuit and other Synergy AI extensions. Relationship safety remains active when this is off. |
| `changedSynergyNpcDialogue` | Contextual creature dialogue. |
| `changedSynergyNpcEmotes` | Contextual creature emotions and native-player expression bubbles. |
| `changedSynergyFactionReputation` | Faction standing changes and their effects on creature behaviour. |
| `changedSynergyInitialFactionReputation` | Reputation assigned when a player first encounters an uninitialized faction account. Default `0`; values are clamped to `-100..100`. Existing records are never overwritten. |
| `changedSynergyBondSystem` | Bond creation, bonded following, rescue, wrapping and companion controls. Existing bonds are kept while the rule is off. |
| `changedSynergyFriendshipSystem` | NPC familiarity, friendship, following and assistance, plus confirmed player friendships and familiarity. Existing records are kept while the rule is off. |
| `changedSynergyTerritoryDisplay` | Territory and facility presentation on the HUD. It does not alter world generation or spawning. |
| `changedSynergyPersonalitySystem` | Stable individual traits and their AI and dialogue effects. Stored traits are not deleted when disabled. |
| `changedSynergyCreatureLife` | Persistence for related creatures, routines, wild communities, gathering, player camps and pure-white reformation. Turning it off pauses camps without deleting members. Individual work switches and relevant vanilla `mobGriefing` restrictions still apply. |
| `changedSynergyHypnosisQte` | Synergy's gaze-based hypnosis resistance, input restrictions and mesmerized penalty. Changed's original hypnosis remains when disabled. |
| `changedSynergyGrabQteEnhancements` | Server-synchronized grab prompts and the post-escape safety stun. Changed's original grab remains when disabled. |
| `changedSynergyNoCivilizationMode` | Default `false`. Temporarily reads regional reputation and local trust as neutral and pauses changes to them. Stored records remain. New autonomous wild outposts are prevented; individual relationships and saved homes remain available. |

## Scope and retained state

Gamerules are world policy, saved in world data, rather than per-client visual
preferences. Server feature switches and a permissive world rule must both
allow an activity. `changedSynergyNpcAI` controls hostility pathfinding, not
all NPC activity: creature routines and camp work use the separate Creature Life rule. Friendship/bond rules pause matching camp members without unregistering
them. The client territory switch changes presentation only.

The initial-reputation UI accepts `-100..100`. Vanilla `/gamerule` allows other
integers; these are clamped when a new reputation account is initialized.

## Updating an older world

`changedSynergyCreatureLife` replaces the old persistence, routine, community, resource, cache, role and white-reformation switches. The separate social-interaction switch was also removed: bonded interactions follow `changedSynergyBondSystem`, while friend interactions follow `changedSynergyFriendshipSystem`.

Old worlds cannot map several conflicting switches into one value reliably, so `changedSynergyCreatureLife` starts at its default of `true`. Servers that had any of those systems disabled should set the new rule explicitly after updating.

## No Civilization Mode

```mcfunction
/gamerule changedSynergyNoCivilizationMode true
```

While enabled, regional reputation and local trust are evaluated as zero. Their stored values are not erased and become available again when the rule is disabled. Individual affection, bonds and personal grievances retain their own rules. Community membership is retained, but trust-dependent rewards cannot be earned while trust is held at neutral. The rule prevents new autonomous wild outposts; it does not remove existing buildings or disable player camps. This is a world rule, not a separate common-config key.
